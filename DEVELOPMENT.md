# Development

This document will (loosely) keep track of my development goals for this project.

## Current Progress

The linear algebra library previously in rusty-machine is now a new crate - [Rulinalg](https://github.com/AtheMathmo/rulinalg).

For full information on what is currently available look at the [crate documentation](https://athemathmo.github.io/rusty-machine/rusty-machine/doc/rusty_machine/index.html).

## Goals

This marks my intended release goals. I won't estimate the actual dates of release but rather the content I want to include in each version. I am actively developing and so expect to move through these at a good pace!

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Version</th><th>Features</th><th>Dependencies</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>0.4.X</td><td>Model improvements</td><td><ul><li>None</li></ul></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>0.4.X</td><td>Nearest Neighbours</td><td><ul><li>None</li></ul></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>0.4.X</td><td>DBSCAN</td><td><ul><li>None</li></ul></td>
    </tr>
</table>

Whilst working on the above there will of course be ongoing development on the existing and new machine learning algorithms.

### Unplanned:

- Convolutional and Recurrent neural nets.
- SVM coordinate descent as per [this paper](http://www.loshchilov.com/publications/GECCO2011_AdaptiveCoordinateDescent.pdf).
